# Chi-Square Test of Independence

Let’s compare the level of SET ratings for Question 3 (The professor used
activities to make the class more engaging.) between senior instructors and 
junior instructors.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| warning: false
#| output: false

#Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(dplyr)

#Load in data
evals <- read_csv(here("data","teacher_evals.csv"))

glimpse(evals) #To have column names

```


**1. Create a new dataset (`teacher_evals_compare`) that accomplishes the following with _one_ `dplyr` pipeline:**

- **includes responses for Question 3 only**
- **creates a new variable called `SET_level` that is “excellent” if the `SET_score_avg` is 4 or higher (inclusive) and “standard” otherwise**
- **creates a new variable called `sen_level` that is “junior” if `seniority` is 4 or less (inclusive) and “senior” otherwise** 
- **contains only the variables we are interested in –- `course_id`, `SET_level`, and `sen_level`.**

Helpful functions: `filter()`, `mutate()`, `if_else()`, `select()`
:::

```{r}
#| label: cleaning-data-for-junior-senior-comparison

teacher_evals_compare <- evals |>
  mutate(SET_level = if_else(SET_score_avg >= 4, 
                             "excellent", 
                             "standard"),
         sen_level = if_else(seniority <= 4, 
                             "junior", 
                             "senior")) |>
  filter(question_no == 903) |>
  select(course_id, SET_level, sen_level)

teacher_evals_compare #Looks good! Data set shows course_id, categorized SET_level and sen_level for only question 3

```

**2. Using the new dataset and your `ggplot2` skills, recreate the filled bar plot shown below.**

![](images/make_plot.png)

::: callout-tip
Helpful geometric object and arguments: `geom_bar(stat = ..., position = ...)`

You **should not** have to do any more data manipulation to create this plot. 

Note that getting the general structure and reader friendly labels is the first
step. The next step is to figure out the labels of the bars and the theme of the
plot.
:::

```{r}
#| label: recreate-plot

#Re-create plot using filtered data set

teacher_evals_compare |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sen_level, #Don't need to specify y because we want y to be a count of the other aesthetics
                       fill = SET_level)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count",
           position = "stack") + #I added this because of the tip above, but is it bad practice to just have 'geom_bar( )' since these arguments are the default?
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue",
                               "orange3")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Seniority of Instructor",
       y = NULL,
       subtitle = "Number of Sections",
       fill = "SET Level")

```

**3. Look up the documentation for `chisq.test()` to carry out a chi-square test of independence between the SET level and instructor seniority level in your new dataset.**

::: callout-tip
Note that the `chisq.test()` function does not take a formula / data specification as we have seen before. You will need to extract the variables you wish to include in the analysis using a `$` (e.g., `evals$level$`).
:::

```{r}
#| label: chi-square-test
# Chi-squared test

```

**4. Draw a conclusion about the independence of evaluation level and seniority level based on your chi-square test.**

# Study Critique

Part of the impetus behind this study was to investigate characteristics of a
course or an instructor that might affect student evaluations of teaching that
are **not** explicitly related to teaching effectiveness. For instance, it has
been shown that gender identity and gender express affect student evaluations of
teaching ([an example](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4?nr_email_referer=1)).

**5. If you were to conduct this study at Cal Poly, what are two other variables you would like to collect that you think might be related to student evaluations? These should be course or instructor characteristics that were not collected in this study.**

**6. Explain what effects / relationships you would expect to see for each of the two variables you outlined.**
